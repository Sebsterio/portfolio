### Next

- form stuff
- redo jQ functions + noscript

## Style

- title backlight (add blurred text shadow)
- About --- custom imgs
- Portfolio --- blur visual when .active
- Portfolio --- project buttons: animate scale
- Portfolio --- description change font. title type maybe too

### Optimization

- change eye & email icons
- intro bg image resize & convert

### Next version

- nav
  -- sticky (hamburger & logo only ?)
  -- CTA -> night/day mode
- sticky filter nav (merge w main nav; black bg)
- widgets viewer
- intro: animate every el
  -- creative add js-tilt or at least parallax or rotate with perspective and - rotate bg in place to make impression as pointer is the camera point
- portrait: color on hover
- title: increase blur radius the closer the el is to window middle
- project rows parallax 2 levels
